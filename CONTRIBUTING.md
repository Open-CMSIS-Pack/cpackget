# Contributing to cpackget

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We develop with Github

We use Github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

All code changes occur via Pull Requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use
 [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add [tests](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/).
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the `make coverage-check` passes, we keep code coverage at 100%.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Open a [pull request](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cpackget/pulls)!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cpackget/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
 [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cpackget/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project.
Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
